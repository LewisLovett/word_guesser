# word_guesser
This is my word guesser project. The languages used are HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. It also uses a random word and definition api.
When the start button is pressed the countdown time starts and a scrambled word and definition in outputted.
The user must guess what the original word is before the computer guesses the word.
The game ends when the time runs out or either the user or computer gets a score of 10.
